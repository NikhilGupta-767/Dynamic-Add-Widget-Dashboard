Project Description: Dashboard Widget Management

This project allows users to easily manage and customize their dashboard by adding or removing widgets. The core functionality of the project includes:

Add Widget: Users can click an "Add Widget" button, which opens a sidebar on the dashboard. This sidebar provides options for customizing and selecting the widgets they want to display on their dashboard.

Customize Widgets: Inside the sidebar, users can choose from a selection of available widgets to add to their dashboard. The customization options allow users to tailor which widgets will be visible based on their needs.

Remove Widget: Users can remove any widget from their dashboard by clicking a "remove" option within the widget. This feature allows the user to declutter their dashboard by removing unnecessary widgets.

Users can configure which widgets to display across all tabs at once, ensuring a consistent and personalized experience throughout the dashboard. This feature allows users to manage widget visibility globally, saving time and effort when customizing their dashboard layout.

This project aims to provide users with a flexible and personalized dashboard experience where they have control over the widgets that appear, enhancing usability and efficiency.


Note*
As the project runs locally, json cannot be updated at run time. So every time user opens the sidebar ( through add widget button ) it will open with the default widgets selected even after user has once configured the widgets.
